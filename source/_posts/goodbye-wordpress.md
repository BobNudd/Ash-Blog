title: Goodbye Wordpress, Hello SSG

I've moved on to [Hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) which is essentially a static site generator catered for blogging.

The process was manually moving assets and articles over, but due to the ability of re-creating articles using Markdown, this was a breeze, and much quicker than any WYSIWYG.

##### The Bad

Wordpress for my scenario was completely unnecessary:

* -Platform & plugins notification updates, pushing various subscription/paid models
* -Constrained to a smaller viewport when writing, hinders the process
* -Tedious formatting code
* -Backend slow on mediocre hosting (relative to hosting static sites)
* -Not a nice place to spent large amounts of time

##### Thoughts

Overall I feel that many blogs jump into the online db driven CMS model, but most of the time it's taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

Wordpress locks you out from the most *important* thing about sharing content, **editorial review**.

[Many people](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io), including [myself](https://github.com/BobNudd/Ash-Blog) host their site as a public repository on Github, enabling corrections and additional content for which both author and readers benefit via PR's. 

I would encourage anyone reading to have a look at the many SSGs out there:
